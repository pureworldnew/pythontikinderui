Frontend gui development using tkinter.

Each records stored in database has about 800 fields, 
which are organized in tables across different sections / tabs.

GUI should support
1) creating a new record by completing each field from user input 
and insert the completed entry into the database.
2) search for existing records from any completed fields from user 
and export the results to excel.
